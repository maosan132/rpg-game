# Todo App

> Main purpose of this project is practicing game development with Javascript. I am using Phaser as the framework. Parcel as the bundler, picked it over webpack as it has fewer configuration (0 in fact), and I will be using JS modern features as modules. API management for scores will also be concerned.
