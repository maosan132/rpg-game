### Objective

> Main purpose of this project is practicing game development with Javascript. I am using Phaser as the framework. Parcel as the bundler, picked it over webpack as it has fewer configuration (0 in fact), and I will be using JS modern features as modules. API management for scores will also be concerned.

## Built With

- HTML5
- Javascript ES6
- ES6 modules
- Webpack 4
- Phaser 3.54
- Microverse Leaderboard API

### Gameplay

Use the arrow keys to control a knight character on the vulcan terrain. You start on the top left corner and you have to navigate through the map to find the exit on the opposite side. You can hit X key to exit to title screen.

You will run into hidden spots where you will be attacked by two enemies during your journey. These spots are generated randomly at different places at game start. Warning: Sometimes it may appear directly inside a fight area, because the hero happens to fall directly on a hidden spot.

When find a hidden spot, the battle screen starts where you decide which enemy to attack each time. Use arrow keys again to select an enemy and left key / space key to attack. This is a turn-based RPG so each of your team members attacks only once. The enemies will attack you when at their turn. The battle continues until you defeat all monsters or be defeated by them.

After each battle your health will be restored.

When a hidden spot is found (there are 30 of them) you appear on the vulcan fight area. On the left side of the screen are the attacking enemies. On the right side is your team. You, the Swordman,  and the Destroyer. Below them are three dark areas. The left one lists the names of the monster enemies, the right one your team, and in the middle are the available commands. Currently, the only available command is 'Attack'.

Your team starts attacking first, one at a time. The attacker's name is in yellow letters. By pressing the up and down arrow you can select which monster to attack. After selecting press left key or space key to attack.

If you kill all the enemies you return to the forest and you can proceed with your quest. If you lose all your team it is 'Game Over' and you are taken to the 'Game Over' scene. If you are victorious at every fight, and get the other corner of the map, you are taken to the 'victory' screen.
